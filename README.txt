#Message Generator Project

##This is a Codecademy practice/portfolio Project
##designed to incorporate cli, javascript and git skills

For this project, you will build a message generator program. 
Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized 
output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, 
like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. 
To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be 
made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of 
JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

####Project Objectives:
+Build a message generator program using JavaScript
+Use Git version control
+Use command line
+Develop locally on your computer

###Prerequisites:
+JavaScript
+Git and GitHub
+Command line

I decided to develop a random nonsensical joke constructor using random words to 
conjugate a question and answer. It makes no sense, but fulfills the requirements
of the project. Technically, I havent learned how to include js in web pages, but that
is how i probably would design it so it is prettier and also take input from user, play 
a laugh track, etc.
